-   `php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install {guard} -f --domain`
-   `php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install {guard} {service} -f --lucid`

## What it does?

-   Model
-   Migration
-   Controllers
-   Notification
-   Routes
    -   routes/web.php
        -   {guard}/login
        -   {guard}/register
        -   {guard}/logout
        -   Password Reset Routes
            -   {guard}/password/reset
            -   {guard}/password/email
    -   routes/{guard}.php
        -   {guard}/home
-   Middleware
-   Views
-   Guard
-   Provider
-   Password Broker
-   Settings

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Through Composer

```
composer require alaminfirdows/laravel-multi-auth
```

### Step 2: Install Multi Auth in Your Project

```
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install {singular_lowercase_name_of_guard} -f

// Examples
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install admin -f
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install employee -f
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install customer -f
```

Notice:
If you don't provide `-f` flag, it will not work. It is a protection against accidental activation.

Alternative:

If you want to install Multi-Auth files in a subdomain you must pass the option `--domain`.

```
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install admin -f --domain
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install employee -f --domain
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install customer -f --domain
```

To be able to use this feature properly, you should add a key to your .env file:

```
APP_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

This will allow us to use it in the routes file, prefixing it with the domain feature from Laravel routing system.

Using it like so: `['domain' => '{guard}.' . env('APP_DOMAIN')]`

### Step 3: Migrate new model table

```
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 4: Try it

Go to: `http://project_url/GuardName/login`

Example: `http://myproject.dev/customer/login`

## Options

If you don't want model and migration use `--model` flag.

```
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install admin -f --model
```

If you don't want views use `--views` flag.

```
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install admin -f --views
```

If you don't want routes in your `routes/web.php` file, use `--routes` flag.

```
php artisan laravel-multi-auth:install admin -f --routes
```

## Note

If you want to change the redirect path for once your `guard` is logged out. Add and override the following method in
your {GuardName}\Auth\LoginController:

```php
/**
 * Get the path that we should redirect once logged out.
 * Adaptable to user needs.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function logoutToPath() {
    return '/';
}
```
